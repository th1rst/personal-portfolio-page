  "aboutArb1": "Originally, this wasn’t intended to be a (sort of) Full Stack and more of a fun project because I love Crypto ever since I got into it in early 2017.",
  "aboutArb2": "Early in the development process, I enabled the “Cors Everywhere” Browser Extension because my local NPM Server kept stressing me. The problem was: I forgot that I had enabled it and finished the Frontend, deployed it to my Webserver and then I couldn’t escape the CORS error messages anymore. So I was left with two choices: don’t showcase the project and use it for myself or stick with it and push myself through building a NodeJS + Express Backend to proxy the calls (for the Coinmarketcap API this actually is the ONLY way to use it). Luckily, I had a spare VPS “lying around” that I had no use for at the moment, so I went for it.",
  "aboutArb3": "After about a day of reading through Documentation and watching Videos about Node and Express, the (very small) Backend was finished, running and working. 'Finally', I thought, and deployed my Frontend… but then Firefox gave me the “Blocked Mixed Content” error because my Frontend was on HTTPS and my Backend on HTTP. After finding out the hard way that I couldn’t get an SSL certificate to work on a “bare IP” VPS (except for self-signed ones), I actually went with a solution of creating a Subdomain, adding DNS/A entries an let Certbot do its magic on my VPS.",
  "aboutArb4": "One feature that I’d like to add in the future is checking the trading volume of coins that show up in the results. Right now, that has to be done manually and that’s a tedious process. Doing so with Frontend code would result in too many API calls for the free tier, so I’m thinking about setting up a MongoDB and caching the trading volumes in intervals.",
  "aboutArb5": "It certainly is a less UI-focused project than my previous ones, and more heavy on sorting, filtering and calculating, but its practical use-case is awesome for everyone who is into Cryptocurrency trading.",
  "aboutArb6": "Note: the Proxy Server is running on a cheap 1-Core Linux VPS located in St. Petersburg, Russia, so load times are increased roughly about +200ms per API call.",

  "aboutPersonalPortfolioPage1": "While there are no fancy technical things to implement (like User Authentication, API calls or Database implementation), I made sure to make it as visually appealing as I could - although I am not a design-savvy person at all. After a certain amount of research, I stumbled upon React-Spring, which is amazing albeit rather complicated - so you'll find various animations throughout the page like springs, trails and transitions.",
  "aboutPersonalPortfolioPage2": "Ever since my last project ('Make Me Awesome'), TailwindCSS has kind of grown on me so I used it again. What I like about Tailwind is that it doesn't come with pre-opinionated components like Bootstrap so there's more room for creative freedom.",

  "aboutMma1": "A while ago, a friend of mine asked me if I could build a 'personal improvement' Webapp for him where he could track his activities and see where he spends his time on (productive tasks vs. unproductive tasks) so he could improve himself and his time management. It sounded boring at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea because it's more 'interactive' than the Sites I've built before... and since I was looking for a new project idea anyways, I thought I'd go for it.",
  "aboutMma2": "Realistically, the App won't have many users, so learning to build a complete Backend for it would be too much - instead, I used Google Firebase Auth and Firestore as a Backend, which, in retrospect, were more than enough new technologies to learn at once. For Firebase auth, I stuck to a Tutorial by Rwieruch which was super helpful and teached me lots of things. While this project took me significantly longer than anticipated (because after Covid Lockdowns I started working full time again), it was SO much fun and although this wasn't my first React project, it finally 'clicked' to the point where I could work my way through the different Documentations to finish this project and had to google a lot less.",
